seven_languages_in_seven_weeks
====

These are the examples that I've worked through for Bruce Tate's "Seven Languages in Seven Weeks". Since I already know Ruby well I've decided to skip those examples

This book has influenced me to learn a few more languages:
* Smalltalk
* Lisp (advanced Lisp in particular)
* Self
* Perl
